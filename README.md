# raptor-dbw-ros2

This fork of the New Eagle [raptor_dbw_ros2 repo](https://github.com/NewEagleRaptor/raptor-dbw-ros2) is provided by Gaia Platform LLC in collaboration with the University of Hawai'i and University of San Diego AI Racing Tech Team.

This is a replacement for `https://gitlab.com/IACBaseSoftware/raptor-dbw-ros2`. It uses the `iac_msgs` defined in `https://github.com/gaia-platform/lgsvl-test-infra/tree/main/src/common/iac_msgs` instead of those defined by `https://gitlab.com/IACBaseSoftware/deep_orange_msgs`.

- Compatible with `AutowareAuto` `ne_raptor_interface` if using the patch set provided at https://github.com/gaia-platform/lgsvl-test-infra/tree/main/src/external/AutowareAuto.
- Supports all IAC messages defined for the 2021 IAC at IMS.
